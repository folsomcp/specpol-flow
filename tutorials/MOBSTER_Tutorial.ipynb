Note that you need to register an email to access the site. The following input was used to obtain the example long list:\n",
    "    * Starting wavelength: TKTKTK  $\\text{\\AA}$\n",

The line mask has a much more simplistic format that makes it easier to parse and manipulate. Additionally, the line mask calculates the effective Land√© factor for each of the lines."

    "The mask tells us the location and depth of all lines in a spectrum but does not tell us about the shape of the lines of the spectrum as a whole. We need a mask to help us weigh each spectral line in the spectrum so that they can be averaged together in an LSD. Given a spectrum and a mask, we can deconvolve the spectrum with the mask to generate an LSD profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a mask we will use the `make_mask` function. The function has the following inputs:\n",
    "* lineListFile - name of the file containing the line list\n",
    "* maskFile - name of the file to write the output mask to\n",
    "* depthCutoff - only include lines in the mask that are deeper than this value\n",
    "* wlStart - optional, use only lines with wavelengths above this\n",
    "* wlEnd - optional, use only lines with wavelengths below this\n",
    "* landeStart - optional, use only lines with effective Lande factors above this\n",
    "* landeEnd - optional, use only lines with effective Lande factors below this\n",
    "* elementsUsed - optional, list of elements to include in the mask creation\n",
    "* elementsExclude - optional, list of elements to exlude from the mask creation\n",
    "* atomsOnly - only include atomic lines (no molecular lines and no H-lines)\n",
    "* includeNoLande - include lines in the mask even if they don't have an effective Lande factor given\n",
    "* DefaultLande - the value for the effective Lande factor to use in the case that a line has no listed effective Lande factor \n",
    "\n",
    "For most cases you will only use the top three inputs and `atomsOnly`. Note that the hydrogen lines are automatically exluded when `atomsOnly` is `True`. This is done since the hydrogen lines have different shape than all the other lines in the spectrum due to their broad wings. The input line list is a VALD line list file and is obtained from the VALD website. More details about VALD is given in `OneObservationFlow_Tutorial.ipynb`. The `make_mask` function will automatically attempt to calculate the effective Lande factor for lines where it is not given, however if one is unable to be calculated it will be excluded if `includeNoLande` is `False` or it will equal `DefaultLande` if `includeNoLande` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example case used below, we are using all atomic lines in the line list except ones without effective Lande factors. We also remove all lines with a depth smaller than the `depthCutoff` of 0.02. The Hydrogen lines are also removed by default, however these lines have very broad wings that lead to blending with nearby lines. As a result, we will need to remove nearby blended lines in the next subsection.\n"
