The long list for this star is provided (TKTKTK), however, to retrieve a VALD long list, one can click the \"Extract Stellar\" button on the [VALD website](http://vald.astro.uu.se/).  Note that you need to register an email to access the site. The following input was used to obtain the example long list:\n",
    "    * Starting wavelength: TKTKTK  $\\text{\\AA}$\n",
    "    * Ending wavelength: TKTKTK  $\\text{\\AA}$\n",
    "    * Detection threshold: 0.01 (line depths shallower than this threshold are not included)\n",

    "The long list file is a text file consisting of a header line containing information on the wavelength range of the list, as well as other information about the content of the file. Each spectral line has four rows of information in the file: the first row contains the most relevant information for making the mask, but the format is rather unpleasant to use. The line mask has a much more simplistic format that makes it easier to parse and manipulate. Additionally, the line mask calculates the effective Landé factor for each of the lines."

We need a mask to help us weigh each spectral line in the spectrum so that they can be averaged together in an LSD. Given a spectrum and a mask, we can deconvolve the spectrum with the mask to generate an LSD profile.\n",

This is done since the hydrogen lines have different shape than all the other lines in the spectrum due to their broad wings. The input line list is a VALD line list file and is obtained from the VALD website. More details about VALD is given in `OneObservationFlow_Tutorial.ipynb`. The `make_mask` function will automatically attempt to calculate the effective Lande factor for lines where it is not given, however if one is unable to be calculated it will be excluded if `includeNoLande` is `False` or it will equal `DefaultLande` if `includeNoLande` is `True`.\n",
