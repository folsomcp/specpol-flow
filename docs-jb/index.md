## About SpecpolFLow

`SpecpolFlow` is a software package that provides a completely pythonic workflow for the analysis of spectropolarimetric observations of astronomical sources (for example, data aquired using instruments such as ESPaDOnS at CFHT, Narval at TBL, etc). It is designed to provide a single, user-friendly pipeline from telescope to science product.

`SpecpolFlow`'s routines handle two computationally challenging tasks in spectropolarimetry: spectral normalization (normPlot) and least-squares deconvolution (LSD) profile calculation (LSDpy). `SpecpolFlow` also provides several intermediate calculation and visualization options, including tools for developing and cleaning line masks, calculating the longitudinal magnetic field, and visualizing the LSD profile. All of these tools are fully documented in the API documentation.

`SpecpolFLow` also maintains a series of detailed tutorials, with examples of how to construct a flexible workflow from `SpecpolFLow`'s tools for your specific needs (e.g., to handle automation for very large datasets using tools like `pandas`, the Python Data Analysis Library). These tutorials are in the form of Python notebooks, which can also be run using collaborative platforms such as Google Colab.
