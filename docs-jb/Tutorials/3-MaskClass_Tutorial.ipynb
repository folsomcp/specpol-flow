    "## What is a Mask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytically, a mask is a function with Dirac deltas at wavelengths corresponding to specific spectral lines. The amplitude of the Dirac delta function corresponds to the line depth. Numerically, a mask is an array of wavelengths with a depth at the center of each line. Thus, a **mask tells us the location and depth of all lines** in a spectrum but does not tell us about the shape of the lines or the spectrum as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we care?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind LSD is to model a spectrum as the convolution of a line mask and a line profile (the LSD profile).  So given an LSD profile and a mask, we can convolve the LSD profile with the mask to get a model spectrum. Typically, though, we have an observed spectrum and a mask but want the LSD profile. This reverse process of going from a spectrum and a line mask to an LSD profile is called deconvolution. **We need a mask to help us weigh each spectral line in the spectrum so that they can be combined into an LSD profile**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mask creation \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the <a href='../API/Mask_API.html#specpolFlow.make_mask'>make_mask</a> function to create a mask. Usually you will only need the arguments *lineListFile* and *outMaskName*, as well as two optional arguments, *depthCutoff* and *atomsOnly*.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lineListFile` is the name of the file containing the line list;\n",
    "- `outMaskName` is the name of the file to write the output mask to (default is None);\n",
    "- `depthCutoff` is a float that only include lines in the mask that are deeper than this value;\n",
    "- `atomsOnly` is a boolean that decides whether to include only atomic lines (no molecular lines and no H-lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Hydrogen lines are automatically excluded when `atomsOnly = True`. This is done because the hydrogen lines, due to their broad wings, have a different shape than all the other lines in the spectrum.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The input line list is a VALD line list file obtained from the [VALD website](http://vald.astro.uu.se). It should be an \"extract stellar\" from VALD in their \"long\" format (to include Landé factors), and it should correspond to the $T_{eff}$, $\\log g$, and chemical abundances of your star.  More details about VALD are given in the tutorial {doc}`../GetStarted/OneObservationFlow_Tutorial`. In the example below, we start with a line list for a relatively hot star ([LongList_T27000G35.dat](https://github.com/folsomcp/specpolFlow/blob/main/docs-jb/GetStarted/OneObservationFlow_tutorialfiles/LongList_T27000G35.dat)). We use all atomic lines in the line list stronger than 0.02, except those without effective Landé factors and the H-lines. "

    "## Mask Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining our mask, the next step is to clean it. **Mask cleaning** involves removing lines that we do not want to use in the computation of LSD profiles. Typically, we exclude lines that fall within the **Telluric regions** and those within the **H line wings**. The lines within the Telluric regions are contaminated by lines from Earth's atmosphere and are therefore unusable. Hydrogen lines can't be modelled correctly in LSD because they have a different sizes and shapes from other lines.  So lines in the H wings, blended with Hydrogen lines, also can't be modelled correctly and are unusable.  Lines blended with other big broad absorption features, such as the Ca H & K lines in cooler star, should also be excluded. Although these will vary with the spectra type of the star. When dealing with stars with emission, care should be taken to **exclude emission lines** as they have different shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will clean the mask using some already defined regions (see {doc}`./4-ExcludeMaskRegionClass_Tutorial` for more details). For a more detailed by hand approach see {doc}`./3b-MaskUI_Tutorial`. First we get the pre-defined telluric regions with <a href='../API/Mask_API.html#specpolFlow.get_telluric_regions_default'>get_telluric_regions_default</a> and pre-defined hydrogen Balmer line regions with <a href='../API/Mask_API.html#specpolFlow.get_Balmer_regions_default'>get_Balmer_regions_default</a>."
