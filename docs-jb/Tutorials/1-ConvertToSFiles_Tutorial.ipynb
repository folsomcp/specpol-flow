    "However, the radial velocity correction from the telluric lines performed by UPENA on *unnormalized files* has often been found to be erroneous (probably because the code has been optimized to work with normalized spectra).

Or it can be set to the first part of a filename, possibly including directories, like `path/root_filename_`, then the files are saved at that path with names like `root_filename_n.s` and `root_filename_u.s`.  Finally, a list of input files can be provided, along with a list of output root filenames, to process several files at once."
