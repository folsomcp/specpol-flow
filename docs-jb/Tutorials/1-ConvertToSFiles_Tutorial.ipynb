    "This tutorial demonstrates how to convert files provided by the various telescopes into the standard '.s' format used in `SpecpolFlow`. \n",
    "The .s format is essentially a text format with columns for wavelength, intensity, polarization, two polarimetric nulls, and uncertainties.  This follow the format from LibreESPRIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more detail, the .s format has two lines of header, which are optional for SpecpolFlow.  The first header line is a comment, the second has the number of pixels in the spectrum and the number of columns of spectrum (not counting the wavelength column).  The rest of the file contains columns of wavelength (usually nm or A), Stokes I (continuum normalized or unnormalized), polarization (continuum normalized or unnormalized), null1, null2, and uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Stokes I, polarization, null1, and null2 data should all have the same normalization.  That way the uncertainty column applies to all four spectrum data columns.  If Stokes I is continuum normalized, the polarization should also be normalized by the continuum flux, not the full Stokes I. E.g. I/Ic, V/Ic, N1/Ic, and N2/Ic (*not* V/I and N/I!).  Or if Stokes I is unnormalized, the polarization spectrum should also not be unnormalized (not even by Stokes I). E.g., I, V, N1, and N2 (again *not* V/I and N/I!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The wavelengths will jump backwards in several places, since data from different spectral orders are concatenated together in the file.  Within one order wavelengths will increase. Places where the wavelength decreases indicates the end of one order and the start of another.  In places where the orders don't overlap, order edges will show up as gaps in wavelength.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that .s files from Narval (and the ESPaDOnS .s files from [Polarbase](http://polarbase.irap.omp.eu/)) are already in the correct format, and so do not need to be converted."

    "\n",
    "For spectropolarimetric observations with SPIRou, the APERO data reduction pipeline generates `[name]p.fits` containing the intensity and polarization spectra.  For regular intensity spectroscopic observations, and each exposure in a polarimetric sequence (typically 4 exposures), the pipeline also generates `[name]e.fits` intensity spectra and `[name]t.fits` telluric corrected intensity spectra.  The main function in SpecpolFlow for converting these to .s files is <a href='../API/Converters_API.html#specpolFlow.converters.spirou'>converters.spirou</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .fits files from APERO contain `nan` values for pixels where the pipeline could not produce reliable values.  Usually these are places where either the spectrum extraction failed (e.g. due to low flux at order edges), or the telluric correction failed (e.g. due to very strong telluric lines).  The converters in SpecpolFlow provide options to: replace the nan values with 0 (and set the uncertainty to 100); remove the pixels with nan, and also remove small fragments of spectrum in regions with a lot of nans; or to just keep the nan values.  Some details are in <a href='../API/Converters_API.html#specpolFlow.converters.spirou'>the API</a>.  Analyzing spectra containing nan values with SpecpolFlow will often lead to errors, so it is usually better to remove or replace those values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The polarization spectrum in the p.fits files is normalized by the total Stokes I flux, not the continuum flux (e.g. V/I, not V/Ic).  The SpecpolFlow tools, and the typical .s format, use either continuum normalized polarization and Stokes I (e.g. I/Ic and V/Ic), or both unnormalized polarization and Stokes I (e.g. just I and V, not V/I).  The SpecpolFlow converter for SPIRou outputs the polarization and Stokes I spectra both normalized by the continuum, using the continuum normalization from APERO.  \n",
